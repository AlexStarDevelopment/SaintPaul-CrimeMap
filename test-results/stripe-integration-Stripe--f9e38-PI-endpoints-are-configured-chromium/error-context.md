        - paragraph [ref=e49]: My name is Alex and I live on the Westside in Saint Paul. I couldn't find reliable crime maps for our city - the public data spreadsheets are buggy and nearly impossible to use. I figured if I was having trouble accessing this critical safety information, others would be too. Building this tool took extensive work cleaning the city's messy data, hand-correcting GPS coordinates, and making it actually usable for our community.
        - paragraph [ref=e50]: "What started as a personal project has become Saint Paul's #1 crime resource, with thousands of monthly users who depend on accurate, up-to-date safety information. I spend 15-20 hours monthly maintaining this tool, ensuring it stays reliable when other resources fail. If this helps you stay informed about your neighborhood's safety, please consider supporting its continued development."
