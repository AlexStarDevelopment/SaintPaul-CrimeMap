### Data Update - October 10, 2025

**New Data Added:**

- Added July 2025 crime data to the database and dropdown selector
- Updated all 2025 monthly data (January through July) with the most recent available information

**Important Note:**
Due to the Saint Paul digital security incident, the police department has been experiencing delays in publishing the most up-to-date crime data. We have been actively monitoring the situation and updating our database as soon as new data becomes available from the city.

While we strive to provide the most current crime information to our community, there may be a lag between when incidents occur and when they appear on the map due to this ongoing situation. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

**Technical Updates:**

- Fixed React hydration errors in dashboard components
- Improved data selection dropdown with July 2025 option
- Enhanced user notifications about data update status
